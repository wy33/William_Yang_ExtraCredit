## Information about the repository

This repository contains the following:
- `subsequence.cc`
- `optimal_multiplcations.cc`

## Parts of the program completed

All parts completed.

## Input File

`dimensions_file.txt`
`dimensions_file2.txt`

## Running the assignment

To compile both programs on terminal, type:

```bash
g++ -c subsequence.cc optimal_multiplications.cc
```

```bash
g++ -o subsequence subsequence.cc
```

```bash
g++ -o subsequence optimal_multiplications.cc
```

To delete executables and object files, type:

```bash
rm subsequence subsequence.o optimal_multiplications optimal_multiplications.o
```

Followup by typing:

```bash
y
```

and pressing enter 4 times to delete all files.

To delete individually, just put files individually after **rm**
and type:

```bash
y
```

once.

To run subsequence, type:

```bash
./subsequence <sequence 1> <sequence 2>
```

```bash
./subsequence apples oranges
```

To run optimal_multiplications, type:

```bash
./optimal_multiplications <dimensions file>
```

```bash
./optimal_multiplications dimensions_file.txt
```
